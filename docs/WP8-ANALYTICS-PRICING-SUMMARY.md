# WP-8: Analytics & Pricing - Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Dependencies**: WP-3 (Vessel CRUD), WP-5 (Booking Request), WP-6 (Escrow & Payments)

---

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive analytics and dynamic pricing system for BlueFleet with:
- Usage analytics and performance KPIs
- Revenue tracking and financial metrics
- Vessel utilization calculations
- Rule-based dynamic pricing engine
- Market insights and trends
- Pricing suggestions with confidence levels

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Analytics Data Model

**Metrics Tracked:**
- **Vessel Utilization**: Booked days vs. total days, utilization rate percentage
- **Revenue Metrics**: Total revenue, platform fees, owner earnings, average booking value
- **Performance KPIs**: Conversion rate, average response time, vessel activity
- **Market Insights**: Demand trends, pricing benchmarks, vessel type popularity

**Calculation Methods:**
- Haversine-based distance calculations (reused from WP-7)
- Time-based utilization rates
- Revenue aggregations by month
- Growth rate calculations

### 2. Analytics API Routes

**GET /api/analytics/overview**
- Platform-wide analytics dashboard
- Role-based data filtering (owners see their vessels, operators see their bookings)
- Revenue metrics with monthly breakdown
- Performance KPIs (conversion rate, response time)
- Booking status breakdown
- Vessel type distribution

**GET /api/analytics/utilization**
- Vessel-specific utilization metrics
- Booked days vs. available days
- Utilization rate percentage
- Revenue per vessel
- Booking frequency
- Sortable by utilization rate

**GET /api/analytics/pricing**
- Dynamic pricing suggestions
- Market average calculations by vessel type
- Demand-based adjustments
- Seasonality factors
- Utilization-based pricing
- Confidence levels (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)

### 3. Dynamic Pricing Engine

**Pricing Factors:**
1. **Market Average**: Calculated from all vessels of the same type
2. **Demand Level**: Based on recent booking volume (last 30 days)
   - HIGH: 50+ bookings → +15% adjustment
   - MEDIUM: 20-50 bookings → no adjustment
   - LOW: <20 bookings → -10% adjustment

3. **Seasonality**: Month-based seasonal pricing
   - HIGH (Dec-Mar, dry season): +10% adjustment
   - LOW (Jun-Sep, rainy season): -5% adjustment
   - MEDIUM (other months): no adjustment

4. **Utilization Rate**: Vessel-specific demand indicator
   - >80% utilization → +10% (high demand)
   - <30% utilization → -10% (low demand)
   - 30-80% → no adjustment

**Confidence Levels:**
- **HIGH**: Utilization >50% AND demand not LOW
- **MEDIUM**: Default for most cases
- **LOW**: Utilization <20% OR demand is LOW

**Rationale Generation:**
- Explains pricing suggestion with specific factors
- Shows market average for vessel type
- Indicates current demand and seasonality
- Displays utilization rate

### 4. Revenue Tracking

**Metrics Calculated:**
- Total revenue across all bookings
- Platform fees (7% default)
- Owner earnings (revenue - fees)
- Average booking value
- Revenue by month (time series)
- Booking count

**Aggregations:**
- Monthly revenue breakdown
- Cumulative totals
- Growth rate calculations
- Trend analysis

### 5. Performance KPIs

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- **Total Vessels**: Count of all vessels in system
- **Active Vessels**: Vessels with at least one booking
- **Total Bookings**: All booking requests
- **Accepted Bookings**: Successfully accepted bookings
- **Conversion Rate**: Accepted / Total bookings percentage
- **Average Response Time**: Time from request to acceptance/rejection (hours)
- **Average Utilization**: Mean utilization across all vessels
- **Total Revenue**: Sum of all booking revenue
- **Revenue Growth**: Percentage change from previous period

### 6. Market Insights

**Insights Provided:**
- **Top Vessel Types**: Most popular vessel types by booking count
- **Demand Trends**: Monthly booking trends with UP/DOWN/STABLE indicators
- **Pricing Benchmarks**: Min/max/average rates by vessel type
- **Competitive Analysis**: Market positioning for each vessel

## Pricing Algorithm Details

### Step 1: Calculate Market Average

```typescript
// Get all vessels of same type
// Calculate average daily rate
avgRate = sum(dailyRates) / count(vessels)
```

### Step 2: Apply Demand Adjustment

```typescript
if (recentBookings > 50) {
  suggestedRate *= 1.15; // +15%
} else if (recentBookings < 20) {
  suggestedRate *= 0.9; // -10%
}
```

### Step 3: Apply Seasonality Adjustment

```typescript
if (month in [Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar]) {
  suggestedRate *= 1.1; // +10% (dry season)
} else if (month in [Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep]) {
  suggestedRate *= 0.95; // -5% (rainy season)
}
```

### Step 4: Apply Utilization Adjustment

```typescript
if (utilizationRate > 80) {
  suggestedRate *= 1.1; // +10% (high demand)
} else if (utilizationRate < 30) {
  suggestedRate *= 0.9; // -10% (low demand)
}
```

### Step 5: Determine Confidence

```typescript
if (utilizationRate > 50 && demandLevel !== "LOW") {
  confidence = "HIGH";
} else if (utilizationRate < 20 || demandLevel === "LOW") {
  confidence = "LOW";
} else {
  confidence = "MEDIUM";
}
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **No UI Dashboard**: API endpoints implemented but no frontend dashboard
2. **Simple Pricing Rules**: Basic rule-based pricing, not ML-powered
3. **No Historical Trends**: No year-over-year comparisons
4. **No Forecasting**: No predictive analytics
5. **No Competitor Data**: No external market data integration
6. **No Custom Reports**: No report builder or export functionality
7. **No Real-time Updates**: Analytics calculated on-demand, not cached

### Planned Enhancements

**High Priority:**
1. Build analytics dashboard UI with charts (Recharts)
2. Add historical trend analysis
3. Implement caching for expensive calculations
4. Add export functionality (CSV/PDF)
5. Create pricing recommendation acceptance workflow

**Medium Priority:**
6. Implement ML-based pricing (TensorFlow.js)
7. Add forecasting and predictions
8. Integrate external market data
9. Add custom report builder
10. Implement real-time analytics with Redis

**Low Priority:**
11. Add A/B testing for pricing strategies
12. Implement anomaly detection
13. Add competitor price tracking
14. Create analytics API for third-party integrations
15. Build mobile analytics app
