## Technical Implementation

### Data Model

Updated Prisma schema:
```prisma
model KycRecord {
  id         String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId     String
  status     KycStatus @default(DRAFT)
  fields     Json      // Stores all form data
  reviewerId String?
  createdAt  DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime  @updatedAt
  user       User      @relation("UserKycRecords")
  reviewer   User?     @relation("ReviewerKycRecords")
}

enum KycStatus {
  DRAFT
  SUBMITTED
  APPROVED
  REJECTED
}
```

### Validation

Zod schemas for each step:
- `personalInfoSchema` - Step 1 validation
- `businessDetailsSchema` - Step 2 validation
- `documentUploadSchema` - Step 3 validation
- `verificationSchema` - Step 4 validation
- `kycFormSchema` - Combined schema for final submission

### API Endpoints

**User Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/kyc` - Submit KYC application
- `GET /api/kyc` - Get user's KYC records

**Admin Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/admin/kyc/[id]/approve` - Approve KYC application
- `POST /api/admin/kyc/[id]/reject` - Reject KYC application (requires notes)

### State Machine

```
DRAFT → SUBMITTED → APPROVED
                 → REJECTED → (resubmit) → SUBMITTED
```

- Users can save drafts and return later
- Only SUBMITTED applications can be reviewed
- Approved applications grant full platform access
- Rejected applications can be edited and resubmitted
