**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Developer**: AI Assistant

---

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive vessel management system for BlueFleet, allowing vessel owners to create, edit, and manage their vessel listings with a multi-tab interface covering specifications, media, compliance, pricing, and availability.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Tab Vessel Form

A sophisticated form interface with 5 tabs:

- **ðŸ“‹ Specs Tab**: Vessel specifications and emissions profile
- **ðŸ“¸ Media Tab**: Image management with reordering
- **âœ… Compliance Tab**: Certification and document management
- **ðŸ’° Pricing Tab**: Rate configuration and inclusions
- **ðŸ“… Availability Tab**: Date range picker for booking periods

### 2. Owner Dashboard

- Statistics cards (total vessels, active, draft, bookings)
- Vessel cards with thumbnails and status badges
- Quick actions (edit, view)
- Empty state with call-to-action
- Responsive grid layout

### 3. Vessel CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Multi-step form with validation
- **Read**: List view and detail view
- **Update**: Edit existing vessels
- **Delete**: With active booking protection

### 4. Draft & Publish Workflow

- Save as draft (DRAFT status)
- Publish when ready (ACTIVE status)
- Required field validation
- Auto-save to localStorage

---

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

Uses existing Prisma models:
- `Vessel` - Main vessel data
- `VesselMedia` - Images with sorting
- `Certification` - Compliance documents
- `AvailabilitySlot` - Booking periods

### Validation

Zod schemas for type-safe validation:
- `vesselSpecsSchema` - Name, type, dimensions, tonnage, registration
- `emissionsSchema` - CO2, NOx, SOx compliance
- `pricingSchema` - Rates, currency, deposits
- `mediaSchema` - Image URLs and metadata
- `certificationSchema` - Cert type, issuer, expiry
- `availabilitySlotSchema` - Date ranges

### API Routes

**GET /api/vessels**
- List vessels with optional filters (ownerId, status)
- Includes media, certifications, availability, owner info

**POST /api/vessels**
- Create new vessel
- Requires OWNER or ADMIN role
- Validates required fields
- Generates unique slug

**GET /api/vessels/[id]**
- Get vessel by ID
- Includes all related data

**PATCH /api/vessels/[id]**
- Update vessel
- Ownership verification
- Updates vessel, media, certs, availability

**DELETE /api/vessels/[id]**
- Delete vessel
- Checks for active bookings
- Cascade deletes related records

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields for Publish

**Specs:**
- Vessel name (min 2 chars)
- Vessel type (enum)
- Length, beam, draft (positive numbers)
- Gross tonnage, deadweight (positive numbers)
- Year built (1900 - current year)
- Flag state (min 2 chars)

## Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Access

- **OWNER**: Can create, edit, delete own vessels
- **ADMIN**: Can create, edit, delete any vessel
- **OPERATOR**: Read-only access (future)
- **REGULATOR**: Read-only access (future)

### Ownership Verification

- Vessel edit/delete checks `ownerId === user.id`
- Admin role bypasses ownership check
- Middleware protects `/owner/*` routes

### Data Validation

- Server-side validation with Zod
- Client-side validation for UX
- Type-safe API responses

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Image Upload**: Currently uses URL input (file upload not implemented)
2. **Public Vessel Page**: `/vessel/[slug]` not yet implemented
3. **Search**: No search/filter on vessel list
4. **Bulk Operations**: No bulk update/delete

### Planned Enhancements

**High Priority:**
1. File upload for images (Vercel Blob/S3)
2. Image optimization and resizing
3. Public vessel detail page
4. Vessel search and filters

**Medium Priority:**
5. Bulk availability update
6. CSV export
7. Performance analytics dashboard
8. Vessel cloning feature

**Low Priority:**
9. Drag-and-drop image upload
10. Calendar view for availability
11. Vessel comparison tool
12. Booking history on vessel page

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing

**Test as Owner:**
```bash
# Sign in
Email: owner@bluefleet.com
Password: password123

# Navigate to
http://localhost:3001/owner/vessels

# Test scenarios:
1. View vessel list (should see 3 vessels)
2. Click "Add New Vessel"
3. Fill all tabs and save draft
4. Edit existing vessel
5. Publish vessel
6. Try to delete vessel
```

**Test as Admin:**
```bash
# Sign in
Email: admin@bluefleet.com
Password: password123

# Navigate to
http://localhost:3001/owner/vessels

# Test scenarios:
1. View all vessels (from all owners)
2. Edit any vessel (ownership bypass)
3. Delete any vessel
```

### API Testing

```bash
# List vessels
curl http://localhost:3001/api/vessels

# Get vessel by ID
curl http://localhost:3001/api/vessels/[id]

# Create vessel (requires auth)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/vessels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"specs": {...}, "media": [...], ...}'

# Update vessel (requires auth)
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3001/api/vessels/[id] \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "ACTIVE"}'

# Delete vessel (requires auth)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/vessels/[id]
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries

- Efficient includes for related data
- Indexed fields: `id`, `slug`, `ownerId`, `status`
- Pagination ready (not yet implemented)

### Client-Side

- Auto-save to localStorage (prevents data loss)
- Optimistic UI updates
- Image lazy loading (future)

### Future Optimizations

- Implement pagination for vessel list
- Add caching for public vessel pages
- Optimize image delivery with CDN
- Add database indexes for search

---

## Conclusion

WP-3 successfully implements a complete vessel management system with:
- âœ… Multi-tab form interface
- âœ… CRUD operations with validation
- âœ… Role-based access control
- âœ… Draft/publish workflow
- âœ… Owner dashboard
- âœ… Test data and documentation

The system is ready for integration with WP-4 (Search & Filters) and WP-5 (Booking Request).
