# WP-6: Escrow & Payments - Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Dependencies**: WP-5 (Booking Request)

---

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive escrow payment system for BlueFleet with:
- Templated contract generation with PDF export
- In-app e-signature workflow
- Escrow payment integration (Paystack primary, Flutterwave fallback)
- Multi-currency support (NGN/USD)
- Automated escrow release triggers
- Payment webhook handlers
- Transaction tracking and audit logs

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Contract Generation

**Automated Contract Creation:**
- Generate contracts from accepted bookings
- Templated HTML-to-PDF conversion using Puppeteer + Chromium
- SHA-256 hash generation for document integrity
- Contract versioning support
- Immutable contract storage

**Contract Template Includes:**
- Parties information (Owner & Operator)
- Vessel details (name, type, IMO, home port)
- Charter period (start, end, duration, purpose)
- Financial terms (daily rate, total, deposit, fuel/crew inclusion)
- Operational details (cargo type, route)
- Special requirements and custom clauses
- Standard terms & conditions (payment, delivery, insurance, compliance, cancellation, dispute resolution)
- Signature sections for both parties

**Contract Status Flow:**
```
DRAFT → PENDING_SIGNATURES → PARTIALLY_SIGNED → FULLY_SIGNED
```

### 2. E-Signature Workflow

**In-App Signature System:**
- Signature pad for digital signatures (base64 encoded)
- Role-based signing (OWNER vs OPERATOR)
- Signature verification and authorization
- Prevents duplicate signatures
- Tracks who signed and when
- Automatic status updates (partially signed → fully signed)
- Contract marked as `signedAt` when both parties sign

**Authorization:**
- Only owner and operator can sign their respective contracts
- Role mismatch prevention
- Duplicate signature prevention
- Full audit trail of signatures

### 3. Escrow Payment Integration

**Payment Providers:**
- **Primary**: Paystack (NGN/USD support)
- **Fallback**: Flutterwave (NGN/USD support)
- Webhook-based status updates
- Idempotent transaction handling

**Payment Flow:**
1. Operator initiates escrow payment after contract is fully signed
2. System calculates total amount (charter fee + security deposit)
3. Platform fee calculated (7% default)
4. Payment provider initialized with transaction reference
5. Operator redirected to payment gateway
6. Webhook updates escrow status upon successful payment
7. Escrow marked as FUNDED
8. Upon charter completion, escrow released to owner

**Escrow Status States:**
- **PENDING**: Awaiting payment
- **PROCESSING**: Payment being processed
- **FUNDED**: Escrow successfully funded
- **RELEASED**: Payment released to owner
- **REFUNDED**: Payment refunded to operator
- **FAILED**: Payment failed
- **DISPUTED**: Payment under dispute

### 4. Multi-Currency Support

**Supported Currencies:**
- NGN (Nigerian Naira)
- USD (US Dollar)

**Amount Handling:**
- Amounts stored in minor units (kobo for NGN, cents for USD)
- Automatic conversion for provider APIs
- Currency-specific formatting
- Platform fee calculation in respective currency

### 5. Escrow Release Triggers

**Automated Release Conditions:**
- Charter period must have ended
- Escrow must be in FUNDED status
- Early release requires admin approval
- Release reason required for audit trail

**Manual Release:**
- Operator, owner, or admin can trigger release
- Release reason logged for compliance
- Payout initiated to owner via payment provider
- Full audit trail maintained

### 6. Payment Webhooks

**Webhook Handlers:**
- Paystack webhook verification (HMAC SHA-512)
- Flutterwave webhook verification (SHA-256)
- Signature validation for security
- Idempotent event processing
- Status update logging

**Supported Events:**
- `charge.success` (Paystack)
- `charge.completed` (Flutterwave)
- Automatic escrow status updates
- Transaction logs with provider references

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

Uses existing Prisma models:

```prisma
model Contract {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  bookingId  String   @unique
  version    Int      @default(1)
  pdfUrl     String?
  hash       String?  // SHA-256 of the PDF
  signedAt   DateTime?
  signerIds  String[]
  booking    Booking
}

model EscrowTransaction {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  bookingId  String   @unique
  provider   String   // PAYSTACK or FLUTTERWAVE
  currency   String   // NGN or USD
  amount     Int      // in minor units (kobo/cents)
  fee        Int      // platform fee in minor units
  status     String   // PENDING, FUNDED, RELEASED, etc.
  logs       Json     // audit trail
  booking    Booking
}
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **No Actual Payment Provider Integration**: Mock payment URLs for MVP
2. **No Blob Storage**: PDFs not actually stored (mock URLs)
3. **No Email Notifications**: Users not notified of contract/payment events
4. **No Signature Images**: Signature data not stored as images
5. **No Payout Automation**: Escrow release doesn't trigger actual payout
6. **No Dispute Resolution**: No UI for handling payment disputes
7. **No Refund Workflow**: No automated refund process

### Planned Enhancements

**High Priority:**
1. Integrate actual Paystack API (initialize transaction, verify payment)
2. Integrate actual Flutterwave API
3. Implement Vercel Blob storage for PDFs and signatures
4. Add email notifications (contract ready, payment received, escrow released)
5. Implement automated payout to owners
6. Add payment receipt generation

**Medium Priority:**
7. Implement dispute resolution workflow
8. Add refund processing
9. Add payment retry logic for failed transactions
10. Implement installment payment option
11. Add payment reminders
12. Create financial dashboard for owners

**Low Priority:**
13. Multi-signature contracts (multiple owners/operators)
14. Contract amendments and versioning
15. Payment analytics and reporting
16. Tax calculation and reporting
17. Currency conversion rates
18. Payment method preferences

# 3. Verify contract created with PDF URL and hash
# 4. Check contract status is PENDING_SIGNATURES
```

**Test Contract Signing:**
```bash
# 1. Sign in as owner
# 2. Navigate to booking detail
# 3. Click "Sign Contract"
# 4. Draw signature and submit
# 5. Verify contract status is PARTIALLY_SIGNED

# 6. Sign in as operator
# 7. Navigate to booking detail
# 8. Click "Sign Contract"
# 9. Draw signature and submit
# 10. Verify contract status is FULLY_SIGNED
# 11. Verify signedAt timestamp is set
```

**Test Escrow Initiation:**

      "metadata": {
        "escrowId": "escrow_id_here"
      }
    }
  }'

# Verify escrow status updated to FUNDED
```

**Test Escrow Release:**
```bash
# 1. Ensure escrow is FUNDED
# 2. Ensure charter period has ended
