**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Developer**: AI Assistant

---

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive booking request system for BlueFleet, enabling operators to request vessel charters and owners to manage booking requests with accept/counter/reject workflows. The system supports negotiation history, status tracking, and cost calculations.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Booking Request Flow

**Operator Side:**
- Request booking from vessel detail page
- Select booking dates (start/end)
- Provide booking details (purpose, cargo type, route, crew, requirements)
- Real-time cost calculation
- Date validation (future dates, no overlaps)
- Availability validation

**Owner Side:**
- View all booking requests for their vessels
- Accept, counter, or reject requests
- View detailed booking information
- Revenue calculations
- Operator information

### 2. Booking Request Dialog

- Modal form with comprehensive fields
- Date picker with validation
- Real-time cost summary
- Purpose description (required, min 10 chars)
- Optional fields: cargo type, route, crew, special requirements, custom clauses
- Validation against vessel availability
- Overlap detection with existing bookings

### 3. Booking Dashboards

**Operator Dashboard** (`/operator/bookings`):
- Statistics cards (Total, Requested, Countered, Accepted, Cancelled)
- Booking list with vessel thumbnails
- Status badges with color coding
- Quick actions (View Details, Cancel Request)
- Empty state with call-to-action

**Owner Dashboard** (`/owner/bookings`):
- Statistics cards (Total, Pending, Countered, Accepted, Cancelled)
- Booking list with operator information
- Highlighted pending requests (blue border)
- "Action Required" indicator
- Quick review actions

### 4. Booking Detail Pages

**Operator View** (`/operator/bookings/[id]`):
- Vessel information with thumbnail
- Booking period with formatted dates
- Complete booking terms
- Cost summary
- Owner information
- Status-based actions (Cancel, Review Counter, Proceed to Contract)

**Owner View** (`/owner/bookings/[id]`):
- Vessel information
- Requested period
- Operator request details
- Revenue summary
- Operator information
- Status-based actions (Accept, Counter, Reject)

### 5. Booking Status Management

**Status Flow:**
```
REQUESTED → COUNTERED → ACCEPTED
         ↓           ↓
      CANCELLED  CANCELLED
```

**Status Descriptions:**
- **REQUESTED**: Awaiting owner response (blue)
- **COUNTERED**: Owner proposed changes (yellow)
- **ACCEPTED**: Booking confirmed (green)
- **CANCELLED**: Booking cancelled (red)

### 6. Validation & Business Logic

**Date Validation:**
- Start date must be in the future
- End date must be after start date
- Dates must fall within vessel availability slots
- No overlap with existing bookings

**Authorization:**
- Operators can only view/cancel their own bookings
- Owners can only view/manage bookings for their vessels
- Admins can view all bookings

**Cost Calculation:**
- Daily rate × number of days
- Security deposit (if applicable)
- Total cost with currency formatting

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

Uses existing Prisma `Booking` model:
```prisma
model Booking {
  id         String        @id @default(cuid())
  vesselId   String
  operatorId String
  start      DateTime
  end        DateTime
  terms      Json          // Flexible terms storage
  status     BookingStatus @default(REQUESTED)
  createdAt  DateTime      @default(now())
  vessel     Vessel
  operator   User
  contract   Contract?
  escrow     EscrowTransaction?
}

enum BookingStatus {
  REQUESTED
  COUNTERED
  ACCEPTED
  CANCELLED
}
```

**Terms JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "purpose": "Crude oil transportation",
  "cargoType": "Crude oil",
  "route": "Lagos → Port Harcourt",
  "estimatedCrew": 15,
  "specialRequirements": "...",
  "customClauses": "...",
  "history": [
    {

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **No Counter Offer UI**: Counter offer functionality exists in API but no UI
2. **No Email Notifications**: Users not notified of status changes
3. **No Negotiation Thread**: No chat/messaging for negotiation
4. **No Booking Modification**: Cannot modify dates after creation
5. **No Cancellation Policy**: No rules for cancellation fees/deadlines

### Planned Enhancements

**High Priority:**
1. Implement counter offer UI with pricing/date changes
2. Add email notifications for all status changes
3. Implement negotiation thread/messaging
4. Add booking modification workflow
5. Implement cancellation policy and fees

**Medium Priority:**
6. Add calendar view for bookings
7. Implement booking conflicts resolution
8. Add booking templates for repeat customers
9. Implement bulk booking for multiple vessels
10. Add booking analytics dashboard

**Low Priority:**
11. Export bookings to CSV/PDF
12. Booking reminders (upcoming trips)
13. Booking history and patterns
14. Recommended vessels based on booking history

## Performance

- **Booking Creation**: <500ms
